## Credits
Couldn't find exact save icon used in demo, so I used the check2 icon found here: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/check2/

Special Thanks to TAs Ian and Diem for all of their invaluable help during this project. I would also like to thank my tutor Rukshan Uddin for helping me better understand some of the code and giving me some resources that really helped me finish this project.
